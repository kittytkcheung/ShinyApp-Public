# ShinyApp-Public

This Shiny App was created as a final project by 4 total members. We scraped US News university rankings (https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities), and display some data, analysis, and visualizations, allowing for interactive user input.  In addition, some user inputs can be controlled by voice commands. Some visualizations include comparisons of school ranking vs endowment, public vs private universities, graduation rate vs student teacher ratios etc.
